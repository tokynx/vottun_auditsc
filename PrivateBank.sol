//1. Reentrancy Attack: The line (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}(""); in the withdraw() function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This is because an attacker could call the withdraw() function recursively before the contractâ€™s balance is set to zero.
//1. Fix: Update state (balances[msg.sender] = 0) before making the external call to transfer Ether.
//2. Function Visibility: getUserBalance() is marked as public, but this function is not needed to be public as it is meant to be used internally.
//2. Fix: Change the visibility to internal or private to restrict unnecessary external access.
